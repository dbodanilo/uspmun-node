		<p>Model United Nations, also known as Model UN or MUN, is an educational simulation and/or academic activity in which students
			can learn about diplomacy, international relations, and the United Nations. MUN involves and teaches participants researching,
			public speaking, debating, and writing skills, in addition to critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilities. Usually
			an extracurricular activity, some schools also offer Model UN as a class. It is meant to engage students and allow them
			to develop deeper understanding into current world issues.</p>
		<p>Participants in Model United Nations conferences, known as delegates, are placed in committees and assigned countries to
			represent, or occasionally other organizations or political figures, where they represent members of that body. They are
			presented with their assignments in advance, along with a topic or topics that their committee will discuss. Delegates
			conduct research before conferences and formulate positions that they will then debate with their fellow delegates in
			the committee, staying true to the actual position of the member they represent. At the end of a conference, the best-performing
			delegates in each committee, as well as delegations, are sometimes recognized with awards.</p>
