                <p>Yusuke has dark blue hair with parted bangs slightly covering his left eye and gray eyes. His in-game character
                    model is noticeably taller and thinner than those of other male characters. His fellow Phantom Thieves
                    Ann Takamaki and Ryuji Sakamoto both describe him as a "pretty boy."</p>
                <p>Yusuke does not wear Kosei High's regulation uniform, unlike his fellow student, Hifumi Togo. His winter-variant
                    uniform consists of a white gakuran-style shirt embroidered with a fleur-de-lis, fitted black pants and
                    black loafers. A silver ring, that holds multiple keys, is attached to his belt loop. His summer-variant
                    uniform replaces the white dress shirt with an ultramarine colored button-down, which Yusuke wears with
                    the sleeves rolled-up to his elbows.</p>
